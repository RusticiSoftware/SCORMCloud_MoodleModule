// Sometimes, changes between versions involve
// alterations to database structures and other
// major things that may break installations.
//
// The upgrade function in this file will attempt
// to perform all the necessary actions to upgrade
// your older installtion to the current version.
//
// If there's something it cannot do itself, it
// will tell you what you need to do.
//
// The commands in here will all be database-neutral,
// using the functions defined in lib/ddllib.php
