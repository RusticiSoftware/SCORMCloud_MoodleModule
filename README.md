### Usage
Create a course as usual in Moodle, but select the SCORM Cloud format option from the dropdown. After you finish the standard Moodle course configuration, the SCORM Cloud module will display a form for you to upload your SCORM course to the Cloud.

You can also use SCORM Cloud courses within other Moodle course formats like "weekly" by selecting "SCORM Cloud Course" from the "Add an activity" dropdown on the course outline page.
